# Sudoku Online

This is a web-based implementation of Sudoku.  The intent is to allow the user to play Sudoku through a web browser with certain restrictions on the moves they can make.  Server-side code will track and assist gameplay.

To run the client locally:

$ cd sudoku-client

$ npm start

To build the client files for distribution:

$ cd sudoku-client

$ npm run build

To run the tests (once we have some):

$ cd sudoku-client

$ npm test
