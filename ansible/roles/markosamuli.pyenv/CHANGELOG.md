[4.0.2]: https://github.com/markosamuli/ansible-pyenv/releases/tag/v4.0.2

## [4.0.1] - 2020-09-05

This release addresses installation issues and adds additional test environments
using Docker images.

[4.0.1]: https://github.com/markosamuli/ansible-pyenv/releases/tag/v4.0.1

### Fixed

- Run `brew into` in Ansible `shell` module instead of `command` to use the
  existing shell environment.
- Do not use Homebrew OpenSSL on Debian stretch or Ubuntu xenial to fix Python
  3.7 and 3.8 install failing due to OpenSSL not being found.
- Debian: Install `python3-openssl` instead of `python-openssl` on Debian
  buster.
- Add `black` compatible `flake8` configuration.

### Changed

Improved `run-tests.sh` script and error handling if any of the tests fail.

- Add `--debug` option to the `run-tests.sh` script that will start a
  container with an interactive shell to allow ad-hoc commands to be
  executed inside the container.

Improve the `update_test_images.py` script to allow additional options to
be provided from the command line.

- Use `click` in the `update_test_images.py` script to allow additional options
  to be provided.
- Add `--list-only` option to return the Dockerfile build target paths
  only so I can use these in my Makefile.
- Add `--distrib` option to update only images matching the specified
  Linux distribution.
- Add `--release` option to update only images matching the specified
  Linux distribution release.
- Add `--git/--no-git` option to update only images for testing the Git
  installation method.
- Add `--homebrew/--no-homebrew` option to update only for testing the
  Homebrew installation method.
- Add `--dockerfile` option to allow images to be specified by the target
  Dockerfile path. This is used by the Makefile to match existing build
  targets.

### CI: Travis

- Skip `shfmt` pre-commit hook as the CLI version is too old and causes
  issues with some formatting.

### CI: GitHub

- Test on Debian and Ubuntu using Docker images on GitHub Actions.
- Install `shfmt` via Go modules instead of using Snap packages.

## [4.0.0] - 2020-09-02

This release adds (experimental) support for installing `pyenv` via Homebrew on
Linux.

Add support and fixes for installing `pyenv` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
macOS Catalina.

[4.0.0]: https://github.com/markosamuli/ansible-pyenv/releases/tag/v4.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Require Python 3.6 or newer
- Require Ansible 2.8 or newer

### Homebrew on Linux

The main purpose of this feature is to allow testing of the Homebrew
installation on my Windows and Linux development environments inside
Ubuntu and Debian Docker containers.

This should be considered experimental and not the preferred way to
install pyenv on Linux as it comes with a few quirks.

To address known issue with pyenv on Homebrew on Linux, the Homebrew
readline package is automatically uninstalled and then reinstalled
while building Python versions with this role.

### Changed

- Install `pyenv` with Homebrew on Linux
- Upgrade `ansible-lint` to v4.3.3
- Add missing directory permissions to ensure compatibility with the future
  Ansible versions.

### Fixed

- Ubuntu: Add missing `libncursesw5-dev` dependency
- Ubuntu: Install openssl when installing via Homebrew
- Fix issue with first time Python installs failing as pyenv has not been
  set up in the user's shell profile.
- macOS: Ensure `gcc` is installed as recommended by Homebrew installer
- Add permissions to the Git repositories while cloning as the default file and
  directory permissions will change in the future Ansible versions.

### CI: Travis

- Run preferred OS builds first
- macOS: Run test builds on macOS 10.15 (Catalina)
- Ubuntu: Use Ansible 2.12 `auto` detection on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instead of the
  `auto_legacy` detection from Ansible 2.8 to detect the Python 3 version
  correctly.
- Ubuntu: Remove Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Ansible 2.9 build
- Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for running `pre-commit` tests

### CI: pre-commit

- Upgrade to `pre-commit` v2.7.0
- Format Python code with black
- Lint Python files with flake8 and pylint
- Test Python files for security issues with bandit
- Add pylint config compatible with black code formatting
- Add Python development dependencies into requirements.dev.txt

### CI: GitHub

- Use the latest Python 3.x version for running tests

### CI: Tests with Docker images

- Update Docker images with Python and Jinja2 templates
- Add Ubuntu 20.04 LTS support
- Do not store test Docker image files in the repository
- Add support for running tests on WSL2
- Install `procps` on Homebrew test images
- Fix missing script permissions caused development environment on Windows FS

### Python 2 support

[Python 2][sunset-python-2] has reached end of life on January 1, 2020.

This role will no longer install Python 2.7 by default.

You can use the previous [2.1.1] version or customise the installed versions.

[sunset-python-2]: https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/

### Python 3 support

This version adds Python 3.8 to installed versions.

The default `global` version is set to Python 3.7.

## [2.1.1] - 2019-11-20

### Changed

- Update to [pyenv 1.2.15][pyenv-1215]
- Update to [Python 2.7.17][python-2717]
- Update to [Python 3.7.5][python-375]

### Development improvements

- Improvements to development and test bash scripts
- Remove Xcode 10.21.1, 10.3 and 11.0 builds on macOS 10.14
- Do not install Ansible 2.8.6 when running tests

## [2.1.0] - 2019-11-03

### macOS Mojave support

This released has a patch for older Mojave releases, but as the defaults seem
to be working again (at least with the Command LIne Tools), I've disabled this
in the default configuration.

Apple security certificates on Travis have expired so installing the macOS SDK
headers on the CI pipelines doesn't currently work.

## [2.1.0-rc.2] - 2019-11-03

### Changed

- Update pyenv 1.2.13 -> 1.2.14
- Added Xcode 10.3 and Xcode 11.2 test images on Travis
- Removed macOS Git install test jobs on Travis

### Fixed

- Do no install macOS SDK headers on Mojave
- Support for BSD sed in `update-python` and `update-release` scripts

## [2.1.0-rc.1] - 2019-07-19

### Changes

- Update pyenv 1.2.11 -> 1.2.13
- Update Python 3.7.3 -> 3.7.4
- Added Xcode 11.0 test image on Travis
- Remove Homebrew packages if using Git installation method

### Fix Python installation on macOS Mojave

The role sets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` and `SDKROOT` environment variables
when installing new Python versions on macOS Mojave.

This fixes [issue #16] when installing Python versions within the Ansible role.

### Use Homebrew as the default installation method on macOS

The Git-based install was enabled to address [issue #16] on macOS Mojave with
the pyenv version pinned down to version 1.2.11. Using an old pyenv version
prevents user from installing the latest Python.

The installation issues with macOS Mojave been been fixed, so I've changed the
default installation method back to using Homebrew packages.

The role doesn't know how to migrate from existing Homebrew installs to
Git-based installations, so it will try to detect any existing installation
and keep using the previous method.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-06-25

### Changed

- Use the Git repository installation method instead of Homebrew packages
  on macOS.

### Fixed

- Fix deprecation warnings when running role with Ansible 2.8.
- Load shell completions only if `.pyenvrc` is found.
- Load shell completions from Homebrew directory on macOS.

### CI/CD

- Define build matrix in job definitions as build stages do not support
  matrix.include configuration.
- Add Bionic to Ubuntu build images.
- Update apt cache on Ubuntu jobs.
- Use minimal image for pre-commit stage jobs.
- Remove python version variable when using generic images as it doesn't
  have any effect.
- Remove duplicate Ansible versions.

## [1.5.1] - 2019-06-09

### Fixed

- Do not set 'system' in global version if it's not available

## [1.5.0] - 2019-06-03
